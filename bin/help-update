Usage: mekano update [options] [bind=value...] [target_name...]

Update one or more targets declared in the Mekanofile. If no target is
specified, all targets are build. Values can be provided, but there are not
interpreted as interpolations, only as plain strings.

A target can either be a file path, a globbing pattern, or an alias. To avoid
shell expansion for patterns, you may want to put quotes around. The easiest is
to declare aliases in the Mekanofile.

Examples:

    mekano update
        Update everything.

    mekano update cc=gcc dist/a.out
        Generate a single file, with a bound variable 'cc'.

    mekano update "assets/**/*.js"
        Generate all the Javascript assets.

    mekano update assets
        Generate the files referenced by the alias 'assets'.
