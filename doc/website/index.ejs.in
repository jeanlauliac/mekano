<h2>What's Mekano?</h2>
Mekano can be called many names, but it is generally recognized as a <em>build
system</em>. It is a tool that automate repetitive tasks on files, like
compilation, minification, etc. Configuring Mekano takes only a few minutes
and brings peace to your project build chores!

<h2>Why Mekano?</h2> Meknao believes in the power of the shell and exposes a
sharp, focused syntax. As such, it needs not any "plugin" at all, and you get a
precise control of what happens. It works out-of-the-box with any tool, whether
it be in Javascript, Ruby… Mekano tracks your files and will do only what is
needed to keep the project up-to-date, no more.

Mekano takes a different stance than tools like
<a href='http://gruntjs.com/'>Grunt</a> or
<a href='http://gulpjs.com/'>Gulp</a>.
